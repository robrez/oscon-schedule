# oscon-schedule
Oscon 2015 schedule using polymer

See a [live demo](http://robrez.github.io/oscon-schedule/components/oscon-schedule/demo/index.html)

See the (useless) [component page](http://robrez.github.io/oscon-schedule/components/oscon-schedule/index.html)

Install with bower:
`bower install --save oscon-schedule`
or
`bower install --save oscon-schedule=robrez/oscon-schedule#master`

This was just for a bit of fun. If I were to take it a few steps further, here is a TODO list:

- Use platinum elements for service worker and a local cache / persistence of favorites and offline capability
- Follow the polymer starter kit pattern for web apps
- Make the header less ugly
- Break up the component a bit more
- Utilize neon animated pages for nice transitions between tabs
